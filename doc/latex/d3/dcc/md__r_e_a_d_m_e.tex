This library defines a structure -- {\ttfamily string}. It records the string content and string length. \textbackslash{} To operate on a string, you must first define a variable of type string. \textbackslash{} At the same time, after using, you need to use {\ttfamily free()} to process the {\ttfamily string\+Content} in the {\ttfamily string} structure.

In addition, if your project needs this library, you need to compile it together.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Detailed}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{String Structure}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
This structure has two elements -- {\ttfamily string\+Content} and {\ttfamily length}. \textbackslash{} {\ttfamily string\+Content} is the content of the string and {\ttfamily length} is the length of the string.

The type of {\ttfamily string\+Content} is {\ttfamily char$\ast$}. After initialization with {\ttfamily init\+String()}, {\ttfamily string\+Content} stores the address of the allocated dynamic memory.

The type of {\ttfamily length} is {\ttfamily unsigned int}. When formatting the output, you need to use {\ttfamily u} to print the value of {\ttfamily length}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Initialize the String Structure}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
After a variable of type string is defined, it needs to be initialized with a specific function. Therefore, use {\ttfamily init\+String()} to initialize a variable of type string. \textbackslash{} This function allocates dynamic memory to {\ttfamily string\+Content}, so when a variable of type {\ttfamily string} is used, be sure to use {\ttfamily free()} for processing. \textbackslash{} The return solution of a function is a structure of type string. The length of the origin string is 1 because there is only one character \textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}0\textquotesingle{} in the string content. \textbackslash{} This function does not pass in arguments.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Add New Content to the String}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
There are two functions to add new content to a string\+: {\ttfamily add\+Character()} and {\ttfamily add\+String()}.

If you only add characters to a string, you can use {\ttfamily add\+Character()}. This function has no return value, it can be said that its return value is {\ttfamily void}. \textbackslash{} It requires two parameters\+: the address of the structure and the characters to be added. \textbackslash{} However, if you want to add a string, in addition to using {\ttfamily add\+Character()} in the loop, you can also use {\ttfamily add\+String()}. This function also has no return value and requires two parameters. \textbackslash{} The two parameters are\+: the address of the structure and the string content to be added. However, the string to be added is of type {\ttfamily char$\ast$}. You can think of it as the address pointed to by the character pointer, and there is a string at the location of this address.\textbackslash{} The working mechanism of {\ttfamily add\+String()} is not to use {\ttfamily add\+Charcater()} circularly.

Both {\ttfamily add\+Character()} and {\ttfamily add\+String()} end with \textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}0\textquotesingle{}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Get the Length of the String}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
{\ttfamily get\+Length()} is used to get the string length. The type of its return value is {\ttfamily unsigned int}. It requires one parameter\+: the address of the structure.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Get the content of the String}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
{\ttfamily get\+String()} is used to get the string content. The type of its return value is {\ttfamily char$\ast$}. It requires one parameter\+: the address of the structure.

It is worth noting that it actually returns the value of {\ttfamily string\+Content}. In other words, it is the same as the value of {\ttfamily string\+Content} -- it is the address of the string content after dynamic memory allocation. \textbackslash{} Therefore, if you want to copy a string, you can use {\ttfamily copy\+String()}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Clear the Contents of the String}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}
{\ttfamily clear\+String()} is used to get the string content. This function has no return value. It requires one parameter\+: the address of the structure.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Copy the String}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
{\ttfamily copy\+String()} is used to copy the string. The type of its return value is {\ttfamily string}. It requires one parameter\+: the address of the structure.

The string returned by this function is not the same address as the original string.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Find the Location of the String}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}
You can use {\ttfamily findstring()} to find the position of the matching string in the original string. The type of its return value is {\ttfamily unsigned int}. It requires two parameter\+: the address of the structure and the string to match. However, the string to match is of type {\ttfamily char$\ast$}. You can also think of it as the address pointed to by the character pointer, and there is a string at the location of this address.

If not found, {\ttfamily NO\+\_\+\+FOUND} will be returned. If found, it will be retruned the position of the first character of the matching string in the original string.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{Cut the String within the Specified Range}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}
Use {\ttfamily split\+String()} to split a string. The type of its return value is {\ttfamily string}. It requires three parameter\+: the address of the structure, start position and end position.

This function will split all characters from the start position to the end position. This function will pack the characters in this range into a {\ttfamily string}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{Replace the Matching String in the Original String with a String}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}
Use {\ttfamily replace\+String()} to replace the matching string in the original string with a string. The type of its return value is {\ttfamily bool}. It requires three parameter\+: the address of the structure, matching string and string to replace. \textbackslash{} The last two parameters are of type {\ttfamily char$\ast$}.

Returns {\ttfamily true} when the replacement succeeds, {\ttfamily false} otherwise.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{Common Problems}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsubsection{What happens if OSError is reported?}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14}
All OSErrors in this library are due to dynamic memory application exceptions. Generally, the dynamic memory application exception is caused by insufficient memory.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsubsection{Why is the value returned by find() a value much larger than the length of the string?}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md15}
That value is often the macro in {\ttfamily LCString.\+h} -\/ {\ttfamily NO\+\_\+\+FOUND}. This value is used to mark not found. However, if this value does not match the value of {\ttfamily NO\+\_\+\+FOUND}, there may be some problems. You can choose to report this problem. Thank you.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysection{Examples}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md16}
